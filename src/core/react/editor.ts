/**
 * Turning a recorded source path into a link that opens the file.
 *
 * Ported from react-source-locator `src/panel/settings.ts` @ 6eb7a30 — the
 * `EDITORS` table, `toAbsolutePath` and `buildEditorUrl`. Divergences:
 *
 *   - **Lines arrive 1-based.** `ComponentSource.line` was converted once at
 *     the source-map edge (plan §4.4), so `{line1}` is the number as stored and
 *     `{line}` is one less. Upstream takes 0-based positions and adds. Getting
 *     this backwards opens the file one line off, every time, silently.
 *   - **No `managed` policy layer.** Upstream lets an administrator push an
 *     editor org-wide; a recorder has no such deployment story, and the setting
 *     lives in the same `chrome.storage.sync` shape as everything else here.
 *   - **The template is validated, not just filled.** The URL is handed to
 *     `chrome.tabs.create`, so a template that produced `https://…` would make
 *     a settings field into a way to open arbitrary pages.
 *
 * Pure — no DOM, no Chrome.
