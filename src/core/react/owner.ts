/**
 * Choosing which component in a chain a click actually belongs to.
 *
 * The nearest component fiber is usually not the one anybody means. Clicking a
 * MUI button lands on `ButtonBase`; clicking a Radix item lands on
 * `Primitive.div`. The useful answer is the nearest component the *user owns*.
 *
 * Two signals say so, and they arrive at different times: the name is known at
 * capture and is a heuristic that says nothing on a minified build, while a
 * resolved path inside `node_modules` is definitive and only exists after the
 * resolver has run. So this is a pure function over the finished table, called
 * at export time — storing an owner on the step would freeze a decision made
 * before the evidence for it existed.
 *
 * Pure — no DOM, no Chrome.

 *      one backed by evidence rather than by a name.
 *   2. Not recognisable as plumbing by name. Weaker, but it is all there is
 *      before the resolver has finished, and all there is on a bundle with no
 *      source maps.

 *      *something* about where the click landed.

/**
 * The feature component the owner sits inside, or null.
 *
 * `pickOwner` answers "where did this click land", and on an app with a shared
 * UI kit the honest answer is often `Button` — the click really did land in
 * `src/components/ui/Button.tsx`. It is just not the answer anybody asked for:
 * what makes the flow useful is that the button was the one in `CheckoutButton`.
 *
 * So this is additive rather than a correction. The owner keeps naming the
 * component the evidence points at, and this names the nearest one further out
 * that is the user's own code and does not live in their primitives folder.
 * Both files reach the reader, and neither judgement has to be right for the
 * other to be useful — which is the property that made changing `pickOwner`
 * itself the wrong move: demoting `Button` in `App` → `Button` would have
 * traded a precise answer for a vaguer one.
 *
 * Only when the owner is itself a shared primitive, which is the whole of the
 * problem being solved. Reporting the nearest enclosing component in general
 * would put `· in App` or `· in ProductPage` on nearly every step of nearly
 * every flow — true each time, worth reading none of them. Silence is the right
 * answer whenever the owner already names something specific.
