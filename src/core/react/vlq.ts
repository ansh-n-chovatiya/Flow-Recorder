/**
 * Base64-VLQ decoding for source maps.
 *
 * Ported from react-source-locator `src/core/vlq.ts` @ 6eb7a30.
 *
 * One deliberate divergence, and it is the reason this file exists rather than
 * being copied verbatim: **decoding is streaming**. Upstream materialises every
 * segment of the whole map as an object graph, which a DevTools panel survives
 * and an MV3 service worker does not — a 30 MB map becomes hundreds of megabytes
 * of JS objects and the worker is killed mid-flow.
 *
 * We only ever want one position. The VLQ fields are *cumulative deltas* across
 * the entire map, so earlier lines cannot be skipped — but their segments need
 * not be kept. `decodeLine` walks forward carrying only the running counters and
 * retains segments for the target line alone, then stops. Memory is O(one line)
 * instead of O(map), and on a minified bundle — everything on generated line 0 —
 * it is also dramatically faster, because it stops after the first line.
 *
 * `decodeMappings` is kept as the reference implementation: it is what the
 * streaming path is tested against, and it is small.
 *
 * Source map `mappings` are semicolon-separated lines, comma-separated segments,
 * each segment 1, 4 or 5 base64-VLQ numbers. See https://tc39.es/ecma426/.
 *
 * Pure — no DOM, no Chrome.
