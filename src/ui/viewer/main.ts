 * would rebuild the step list under the user on every note they finish typing.
 * That much has always been true. What was wrong was the test: a 500 ms clock,
 * which suppressed *every* local change in the window and not merely ours.
 *
 *  - Finish typing a note, then press Stop within half a second, and the
 *    `recordingActive: false` that Stop writes was swallowed along with it. No
 *    further write ever came, so the viewer sat on `status: 'recording'` and
 *    library.ts kept Save disabled — the recording could not be archived
 *    without reloading the tab by hand.
 *  - Same window, press Discard, and the `recordedSteps: []` was swallowed too.
 *    The viewer still held the five steps, and the user's next edit wrote them
 *    back: a recording deleted under "This cannot be undone" came back.
 *
 * And the marker was set *before* the write, so a write slower than the window
 * outlived its own guard and repainted anyway.
 *
 * So: match on content, never on the clock, and only for the keys we actually
 * wrote. A change somebody else made never matches, whatever its timing.
