/**
 * Which of the viewer's two views is on screen.
 *
 * Structural decision A: choosing a flow and inspecting a flow are different
 * jobs, and conflating them is why the old toolbar had seven buttons. They are
 * two views of one page rather than two pages because they share the flow store,
 * the export dialog and the annotation editor — and because Back has to be
 * instant, not a second document load.
 *
 * The route lives in the hash so a flow is linkable: the popup opens
 * `viewer.html#/current` for the recording in progress and `viewer.html` for the
 * library, and reloading the tab lands where it was rather than at the top.
 *
 * Pure — see tests/viewer-route.test.ts.
