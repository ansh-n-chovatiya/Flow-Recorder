/**
 * Every setting FlowSnap has, as data.
 *
 * One entry per Tier 1 and Tier 2 setting. The table is the single description
 * of a setting: it drives the `Settings`
 * type, the `DEFAULTS` object, the clamp in `resolve()`, the input attributes
 * the Settings screen renders, the "reset to default" affordance, and the file
 * `public/settings.default.json`. A setting that exists in one of those and not
 * the others is the failure this shape exists to make impossible — `Settings` is
 * *derived* from `FIELDS`, so a key cannot appear in the type without appearing
 * here.
 *
 * Two rules the table has to keep:
 *
 *   - **Defaults are imported, never retyped.** Every `default` below is a
 *     constant from `shared/constants.ts`. A literal here would be a second copy
 *     of a number that already exists, and the day someone changes one of them
 *     the other would keep shipping. `tests/settings-defaults.test.ts` asserts
 *     the whole table against those constants.
 *   - **`description` is the writing that ships.** These sentences ship as
 *     written, and `consequence` is the rule that a dangerous setting states
 *     its cost next to the input rather than in a tooltip. Neither is
 *     placeholder text to be improved during the UI phase.
 *
 * Pure — no `chrome.*`, no DOM. `index.ts` is where storage happens.

 * `min`/`max` are the range `resolve` clamps to, not a suggestion. They are set
 * where a value stops being a preference and starts being a broken recording:
 * wide enough that nobody with a real reason hits them, narrow enough that a
 * corrupted or hand-edited value cannot make the extension unusable.
 *
 * ## The eight keys with no dot
 *
 * `theme`, `mcpServerUrl`, `mcpAutoSend`, `reactCapture`, `reactResolve`,
 * `projectRoot`, `editor`, `customEditorTemplate` are the settings that already
 * existed, and their names are the `chrome.storage.sync` keys users' machines
 * are already synced under.
 *
 * **They keep them. Decided in Phase 3, and not to be reopened without a new
 * argument** — Phase 0 left the question open and asked Phase 1 to settle it,
 * Phase 1 did not reach it, and Phase 3 is where it became visible, because the
 * export file shows the mixed namespace to the user.
 *
 * The cost of keeping them is cosmetic: eight of seventy-three keys sort oddly in
 * an exported file. The cost of renaming them is not. Phase 0's own migration
 * recipe was "read the legacy key when the canonical one is absent, write only
 * the canonical key, and never delete the legacy one, because an older version
 * installed alongside still reads it" — and *never delete* means the area holds
 * both keys after the first save, with an older build writing one and this build
 * writing the other and nothing deciding which wins. That is precisely the
 * two-writers-no-defined-winner failure this deliberately does not build for a
 * settings file on disk. Deleting the legacy key instead strands the user whose other machine
 * has not updated yet, which is precisely the failure avoided by declining to
 * reject a file on its `$schema`.
 *
 * Both branches are failures this plan has already named and rejected elsewhere,
 * and the thing being bought is that `editor` would sort next to `react.*`.
 *
 * Nothing about the mixed namespace misbehaves: `isSettingKey` recognises all
 * eight, so they resolve, export, import and diff like any other key and the
 * JSON pane never flags one as unknown. `tests/settings-file.test.ts` holds that.
