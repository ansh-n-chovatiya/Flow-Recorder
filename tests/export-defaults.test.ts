/**
 * The dialog's memory and the configured default are two different things.
 *
 * Phase 4's one rule about the export and send dialogs is that they must not be
 * collapsed: `export.*` in Settings is a standing answer, `exportOptions` in
 * local storage is what happened last time, and people rely on both. The whole
 * of the arithmetic is `features/export/defaults.ts`; the whole of the risk is
 * that either half quietly stops mattering, and both failures look completely
 * normal from the outside — a dialog that opens on *something*.
 *
 * So this drives the real dialogs against the real `viewer.html`, with storage
 * and settings both stubbed, and asserts which of the two answers won.
