/**
 * What the resolver may claim when the clock beat it.
 *
 * A pass stops at a deadline, which is right — a pathological site has to cost a
 * fixed amount and then stop. What was wrong is what the stop was reported as.
 * The bundle loop simply `break`s, and both of the states that leaves were being
 * published as finished work:
 *
 *   - Nothing found yet became `not-found`, with the sentence "not found in the
 *     N scripts the page had loaded" written after reading one of them, and a
 *     `searched` count of every script — which told `selectPending` it had
 *     already looked everywhere, so no later pass ever retried it. One slow
 *     minute made a component permanently unresolvable and explained it with a
 *     lazy chunk that had nothing to do with it.
 *   - Something found became `resolved`, because the sweep for duplicates that
 *     would have made it `ambiguous` was the part that got cut. Duplicated
 *     vendored modules make a second copy ordinary, so this is not a rare shape.
 *
 * Both are the failure this feature exists to avoid: not a missing answer, a
 * confident wrong one.
